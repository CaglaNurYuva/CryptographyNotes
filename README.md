Slide1: C. 11. Security Attacks, Countermeasures and protocols Intruders 2 Intruders 3 • Intrusion and Intruder • Password Attacks • Denial of Service Attacks • What layer for security • Firewalls • Web Security
Slide2: Intruders significant issue for networked systems is hostile or unwanted access • either via network or local can identify classes of intruders: masquerader misfeasor clandestine user varying levels of competence
Slide3: Intruders clearly a growing publicized problem - from "Wily Hacker" in 1986/87 - to clearly escalating CERT stats may seem benign, but still cost resources may use compromised system to launch other attacks awareness of intruders has led to the development of CERTS
Slide4: Intruders: What Can They Do? Eavesdrop--(compromise routers, links, routing algorithms, or DNS) • Send arbitrary messages (including IP hdr) Replay recorded messages Modify messages in transit • Write malicious code and trick people into running it
Slide5: Intrusion Techniques • aim to gain access and/or increase privileges on a system • basic attack methodology target acquisition and information gathering initial access privilege escalation covering tracks key goal often is to acquire passwords so then exercise access rights of owner
Slide6: Intrusion Detection • inevitably will have security failures so need also to detect intrusions so can block if detected quickly act as deterrent collect info to improve security assume intruder will behave differently to a legitimate user but will have imperfect distinction between
Slide7: Approaches to Intrusion Detection • statistical anomaly detection threshold profile based • rule-based detection anomaly penetration identification
Slide8: Audit Records • fundamental tool for intrusion detection • native audit records part of all common multi-user O/S already present for use may not have info wanted in desired form • detection-specific audit records created specifically to collect wanted info at cost of additional overhead on system
Slide9: Statistical Anomaly Detection • threshold detection Approaches to intrusion Detection 7 Audit Records 8 count occurrences of specific event over time if exceed reasonable value assume intrusion alone is a crude & ineffective detector profile based characterize past behavior of users detect significant deviations from this profile usually multi-parameter
Slide 10: Audit Record Analysis • foundation of statistical approaches analyze records to get metrics over time counter, gauge, interval timer, resource use use various tests on these to determine if current behavior is acceptable mean & standard deviation, multivariate, markov process, time series, operational key advantage is no prior knowledge used
Slide 11: Rule-Based Intrusion Detection Statistical Anomaly Detection 9 • observe events on system & apply rules to decide if activity is suspicious or not • rule-based anomaly detection analyze historical audit records to identify usage patterns & auto-generate rules for them then observe current behavior & match against rules to see if conforms like statistical anomaly detection does not require prior knowledge of security flaws
Slide 12: Rule-Based Intrusion Detection • rule-based penetration identification uses expert systems technology with rules identifying known penetration, weakness patterns, or suspicious behavior compare audit records or states against rules rules usually machine & O/S specific rules are generated by experts who interview & codify knowledge of security admins - quality depends on how well this is done
Slide 13: Base-Rate Fallacy • practically an intrusion detection system needs to detect a substantial percentage of intrusions with few false alarms Rule-Based Intrusion Detection 11 if too few intrusions detected -> false security if too many false alarms -> ignore / waste time • this is very hard to do existing systems seem not to have a good record
Slide 14: Distributed Intrusion Detection • traditional focus is on single systems • but typically have networked systems more effective defense has these working together to detect intrusions • issues dealing with varying audit record formats integrity & confidentiality of networked data centralized or decentralized architecture
Slide 15: Distributed Intrusion Detection - Architecture LAN Monitor Host Host Agent module Router Central Manager Manager module 15 모모모 Distributed Intrusion Detection - Agent Implementation 13 Distributed Intrusion Detection 14 Distributed intrusion Detection- Architecture 모모모 WAN
Slide 16: Distributed Intrusion Detection - Agent Implementation OS audit information Filter Host Audit Record Logic Alerts Templates Notable activity Signatures Noteworthy sessions Modifications 16 Central Manager Query/ response Agent Protocol Machine
Slide 17: Honeypots decoy systems to lure attackers away from accessing critical systems to collect information of their activities to encourage attacker to stay on system so administrator can respond are filled with fabricated information • instrumented to collect detailed information on attackers activities Dinhributed Intro Dention- Agent Implementation 16 Honeypots single or multiple networked systems • cf IETF Intrusion Detection WG standards
Slide 18: Password Guessing one of the most common attacks attacker knows a login (from email/web page etc) then attempts to guess password for it defaults, short passwords, common word searches user info (variations on names, birthday, phone, common words/interests) exhaustively searching all possible passwords • check by login or against stolen password file success depends on password chosen by user surveys show many users choose poorly
Slide 19: Password Capture another attack involves password capture watching over shoulder as password is entered using a trojan horse program to collect monitoring an insecure network login eg. telnet, FTP, web, email extracting recorded info after successful login (web history/cache, last number dialed etc) using valid login/password can impersonate user users need to be educated to use suitable precautions/countermeasures
Slide 20: Password Management • front-line defense against intruders users supply both: - login - determines privileges of that user password - to identify them passwords often stored encrypted Unix uses multiple DES (variant with salt) more recent systems use crypto hash function • should protect password file on system
Slide 21: Password Studies • Purdue 1992 - many short passwords • Klein 1990 - many guessable passwords • conclusion is that users choose poor passwords too often • need some approach to counter this
Slide 22: Managing Passwords - Education can use policies and good user education • educate on importance of good passwords give guidelines for good passwords minimum length (>6) require a mix of upper & lower case letters, numbers, punctuation not dictionary words • but likely to be ignored by many users
Slide 23: Managing Passwords - Computer Generated • let computer create passwords • if random likely not memorisable, so will be written down (sticky label syndrome) even pronounceable not remembered • have history of poor user acceptance FIPS PUB 181 one of best generators has both description & sample code generates words from concatenating random pronounceable syllables
Slide 24: Managing Passwords - Reactive Checking • reactively run password guessing tools note that good dictionaries exist for almost any language/interest group Managing Passwords-Computer Generated 23 • cracked passwords are disabled • but is resource intensive Managing Passwords-Reactive Checking password guessing tools • bad passwords are vulnerable till found
